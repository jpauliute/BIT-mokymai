        <p><h2>Early life</h2></p>
        <p>Richard Tiffany Gere was born in <a href="">Philadelphia</a> on August 31, 1949,[4] the eldest son and second <br>
        child of housewife Doris Ann (née Tiffany; 1924–2016) and NMIC insurance agent Homer George <br>
         Gere (1922-2023).[5][6] His father originally intended to become a minister.[7] Gere was raised <br>
         Methodist[8][9] in Syracuse, New York.[10] His paternal great-grandfather, George Lane Gere <br>
         (1848–1932), changed the spelling of his surname from "Geer". One of his ancestors, also <br>
         named George, was an Englishman who came from Heavitree and settled in the Connecticut <br>
         Colony in 1638.[11] Both of Gere's parents were Mayflower descendants; his ancestors include <br>
         Pilgrims such as John Billington, William Brewster, Francis Eaton, Francis Cooke, Degory Priest, <br>
         George Soule and Richard Warren.[citation needed] </p>
         
         <p>In 1967, he graduated from North Syracuse Central High School, where he excelled at <br>
        gymnastics and music and played the trumpet.[7] He attended the University of Massachusetts <br>
        Amherst on a gymnastics scholarship, studying philosophy; after two years, he left and did not <br>
        graduate.[7][12]</p>
